\section{Basic Concepts : SI Units, Voltage}
\begin{list}{*}{}
\item Section 1.1 and 1.2 in textbook.
\item Circuit : Motions of charge in a definite closed path. Results in energy transfer  
\item Lowercase q for variable and Upper case Q for constant
\end{list}
\subsection{Current}
Current is the flow of positive charge. \\
\begin{math}
  Formula: \\
  i(t)=\frac{dq(t)}{dt}} \\
\end{math}
\begin{list}{*}{Notation}
\item q(t)=charge 
\item(t)=Current
\end{list} \\

What causes current to flow? \\
A force is required.

\subsection{Voltage}
Voltage signs: \\
+/- signs define 'reference' direction, so point B is at higher potential.

\subsection{Flashlight}
\begin{list}{*}{}
\item Charges \textbf{expand} energy as they move through the bulb.
\item Charges \textbf{gain} energy as they move though the battery.

\subsection{power}
Passive sign convention\\
\begin{list}{*}{}
\item p>0 power absorbed \\
\item p<0 power suppilied.
\end{list}
